# TarjamAI - Flask Arabic Video Transcription and Subtitling Application

This Flask-based application is an innovative tool for video processing and subtitle generation, aimed at enhancing language learning and content accessibility. It integrates the Uppy file uploader and Transloadit for efficient video handling, along with the Whisper API for advanced subtitle generation.

## Key Features
- **Efficient File Uploading**: Utilizes Uppy for a smooth and user-friendly file uploading experience.
- **Advanced Video Processing**: Leverages Transloadit to handle video encoding and processing tasks with ease.
- **Automated Subtitle Generation**: Employs the Whisper API to create subtitles, striving for high accuracy and synchronization.

## Current Development Status
The project is currently in progress, focusing on refining the quality of subtitles generated by the Whisper API. Currently I am not satisfied with the level of subtitles and accuracy provided with the Whisper-v1 API. Will look at incorporating v2 soon once it becomes available and cost-effective. 

## Contributions and Feedback
Your contributions and feedback are highly valued as we work to enhance the subtitle generation feature. If you have suggestions or technical insights that could improve the accuracy of our subtitles, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
